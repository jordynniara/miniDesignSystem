# I know what you're thinkging...
## This portfolio kind of sucks visually. I agree and I'm working on it.
### In the meantime I have a [Figma]() that looks _a lot_ better than this. Plus, now you know I can work in Figma! üòâ
### But since you're here, you can find the same projects hilighted in the Figma, below.

## [Resume]()
Just a resume.
## Prototypes
- [Mini Design System](./projects/mini_design_system/miniDesignSystem/home.html) - A small design system created for my online portfolio. It was built using pure **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5**. This will give you a sneak peak of what to expect here soon!
    - [Figma Design Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1303532172657853033/jns-design-kit) - The design kit created in **Figma** from which design system was derived. Some changes were made in the system as it realized in browser.

- <u>**Neighborhood Woof**</u> - A mobile, web, and smart watch application for dog owners and walkers to help them plot their walks, monitor for oncoming hazards such as other dogs or glass, manage their dog documents. While on a walk, registered owners can send and receive notification regarding other dogs on walks on similar paths. Owners can mark each other friend or foe, enabling the app to reroute their walk to help them meet or avoid other owners and their dogs respectfully. The app can notify or reroute walkers when other hazards such as glass are marked by crowdsourcing as well. Owners can further use the app to track their walks and keep up with their dogs documentation in case of an incident, or report their dog as lost to other owners.
    - [(Mock)Request for Proposal](./projects/neighborhood_woof/Response%20to%20RFP%20for%20Application%20Ideation%20and%20Design.pdf) - A mock response for a request for proposal for an application. My company, UXellence, responds with the idea for Neighborhood Woof.
    - [Prototype](https://taz9bd.axshare.com/) - An **Axure** preview of a prototype for Neighborhood Woof. It includes size adaptations for a desktop website, and a smart watch. Each platform has differing capabilities that are demo'd in the prototype. View the Page Notes on the page for more details.
## Evaluations & Analysis'
- [Turkish Airlines: Usability Evaluation](./projects/turkish_airlines/Turkish%20Airlines%20Usability%20Report.pdf) - An assessment of Turkish Airline's website's usability. The report includes summaries of test evaluations done with real participants, notable findings and recommendations.
- [Dickblick.com Information Architecture Redesign](./projects/blick.com/FinalReportPacket.pdf) - A presentation (pdf format) of an information redesign done of the Blick Material Store website.
- <u>**NYTCooking.com**</u> - A heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthrough of the NytCooking.com website that asseses how well it aligns with Jakob Neilsen's "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" and its learnability respecitively.
    - [Heuristic Evaluation](./projects/nytcooking/Heuristic%20Eval%20-%20NYTCooking.com.pdf)
    - [Cognitive Walkthrough](./projects/nytcooking/Cognitive%20Walkthrough%20-%20NYT%20Cooking.pdf)
- [How to decide where to eat with your significant other: A Flowchart](./projects/flow_diagram/processFlowPacket.pdf) - A comical process flow diagram that breaks down the decision-making process of a couple choosing a place to eat from both the perspective of the decisive and indecisive one. 
## Papers
- [The dominance of western culture in Human Computer Interaction and methods to elevate non-western ideologies](https://medium.com/@jordynniara/western-culture-in-hci-8e16a6781774) - In this paper, I create a basis for how colonialism has negatively impacted research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by limiting its worldview to that of The West. I then review three different research methods currently used within the field for cross-cultural studies and engagement, discussed in the order of Hofstede‚Äôs theory of Cultural Dimensions, postcolonial computing, and decolonial computing and determine best option for the field.
## Artwork
- <u>**Dragon Bellies: An exploration in unity**</u> - An art composition created using **Adobe Photoshop** that visualizes four elements that create unity within an artpiece, including emphasis, balance, scale, and movement. Each ‚Äúbelly‚Äù embodies a different design element all while coming together to create one united piece. See the attached analysis for more details.
